Failed to call `:create_section` on #<Types::MutationType:0x0000000130637000 @object=nil, @context=#<GraphQL::Query::Context ...>> because the Ruby method params were incompatible with the GraphQL arguments:

- `name` is required by Ruby, but GraphQL doesn't pass positional arguments. If it's meant to be a GraphQL argument, use `name:` instead. Otherwise, remove it.

Failed to call `:create_section` on #<Types::MutationType:0x0000000130119230 @object=nil, @context=#<GraphQL::Query::Context ...>> because the Ruby method params were incompatible with the GraphQL arguments:

- `name:` is required by Ruby, but not by GraphQL. Consider `name: nil` instead, or making this argument required in GraphQL.

Failed to call `:create_ingredient` on #<Types::MutationType:0x0000000130cb17f0 @object=nil, @context=#<GraphQL::Query::Context ...>> because the Ruby method params were incompatible with the GraphQL arguments:

- `section: 2` was given by GraphQL but not defined in the Ruby method. Add `section:` to the method parameters.
- `section_id:` is required by Ruby, but not by GraphQL. Consider `section_id: nil` instead, or making this argument required in GraphQL.

Failed to call `:create_ingredient` on #<Types::MutationType:0x00000001263907c0 @object=nil, @context=#<GraphQL::Query::Context ...>> because the Ruby method params were incompatible with the GraphQL arguments:

- `name: Lettuce` was given by GraphQL but not defined in the Ruby method. Add `name:` to the method parameters.
- `section: 2` was given by GraphQL but not defined in the Ruby method. Add `section:` to the method parameters.
- `name` is required by Ruby, but GraphQL doesn't pass positional arguments. If it's meant to be a GraphQL argument, use `name:` instead. Otherwise, remove it.
- `section_id` is required by Ruby, but GraphQL doesn't pass positional arguments. If it's meant to be a GraphQL argument, use `section_id:` instead. Otherwise, remove it.

Failed to call `:create_shopping_list` on #<Types::MutationType:0x00000001307b2bf0 @object=nil, @context=#<GraphQL::Query::Context ...>> because the Ruby method params were incompatible with the GraphQL arguments:

- `name:` is required by Ruby, but not by GraphQL. Consider `name: nil` instead, or making this argument required in GraphQL.
